2018 DC208 Badge Ideas
======================
- Keep existing badge but add features
-- RGB LED's
-- Mic/Speaker combo (replace existing speaker)
-- New MCU with enough juice
-- Audio peak detector (output via LED's)
-- (stretch) ulta-sonic comms to sync special LED patterns
-- (stretch) add-on connector that'll work with other defcon badges
-- (Eventually) Sync LED patterns when other badges are near.
-- (Eventually), have the badges play a tune together when they're communicating with each other.
